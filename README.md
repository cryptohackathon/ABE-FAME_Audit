CryptoHackathon work

My project focuses on a use case of Attribute-based Encryption in which a network of participants send encryptions meant for other participants to a managing server. The participants are able to use attributes to manage who is able to decrypt their ciphertext by implementing policies. While creating this project I focused on an auditing case in which a participant may enable auditing by encrypting it with the policy “Participant OR Auditor” and therefore either another participant or an auditor (as designated by the managing server) would be able to decrypt the ciphertext. This method also enables the participants who distinguish between types of participants who would be able to decrypt their ciphertext. Although it is not displayed in the demo, this project also focused on layering this encryption in a fashion that would allow for a transmission of one ciphertext that had another ciphertext revealed once decrypted allowing only a further subset of attribute-owners to see the second layer ciphertext. The prototype written during this hackathon uses the GoFE library.
